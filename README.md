# Kreatize
This is a very basic Flask application that uploads an stl file to a specific upload folder and displays information to the user about the manufacturing part (like surface area and volume).

The app uses [Trimesh](https://github.com/mikedh/trimesh) library for loading, manipulation and analysis of triangular meshes. You can visit find the library here 

To be able to run the application, install the required packages for the project using "requirement.txt".

You can use  ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` to do that.

To run the app, use flask run. This starts a web server with the application, which can be opened by typing the http://localhost:5000/ URL in the web browser.
