# Kreatize
This is a very basic Flask application that uploads an stl file to a specific upload folder and displays information to the user about the manufacturing part (like surface area and volume).

To be able to run the application, install the required packages for the project using "requirement.txt".

You can use  ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` to do that.

To run the app, use flask run. This starts a web server with the application, which can be opened by typing the http://localhost:5000/ URL in the web browser.
